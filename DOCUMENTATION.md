## Sample Usage

Here are some examples of how you can use the API:

1. Adding a new person:
   - Send a `POST` request to `/api` with the person's name in the request body.
   - The API will respond with the person's details, including the assigned ID.

2. Fetching details of a person:
   - Send a `GET` request to `/api/{id}` with the person's ID in the URL.
   - The API will respond with the person's details.

3. Updating details of a person:
   - Send a `PUT` request to `/api/{id}` with the person's ID in the URL and the updated name in the request body.
   - The API will respond with the updated person's details.

4. Deleting a person:
   - Send a `DELETE` request to `/api/{id}` with the person's ID in the URL.
   - The API will respond with no content if the deletion is successful.

## Limitations and Assumptions

Please note the following limitations and assumptions of the API:

- The API assumes that the ID provided in the URL for fetching, updating, or deleting a person exists in the database. If the ID is invalid, an error will be returned.
- The API does not support bulk operations for creating, updating, or deleting multiple persons at once.
- The API does not implement any authentication or authorization mechanisms. It assumes unrestricted access to the endpoints.

## Setup and Deployment

To set up and deploy the API locally or on a server, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies using Composer.
3. Configure the database connection in the `.env` file.
4. Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables.
5. Start the Laravel development server.
6. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` or the specified URL.
